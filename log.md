# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 10th, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Working on the code of my #DailyUI design. I got some of it done, about 30% I think. I have to finish it tomorrow morning so I can do tomorrows coding too.

**Thoughts:**: Struggled with time managment. I wasted time thinking what was going to be today's task. Tomorrow I have to be more efficient in my thought process.

### Day 2: April 11th, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I worked on the code of a design I did for the Daily UI (day 2). It was about a credit card checkout. I need to solidify my knowledge about CSS, so I'm trying write as much css as I can. Nothing fancy, but it has to be functional. I went deep into pseudoelements, background, positioning with z-index, some event listeners on javascript, for the button & input effects.

**Thoughts:**: It's not easy to find time to do everything, I'm struggling with it, but I think it going to be worth. Besides I'm practicing my english, which is nice.

### Day 3: April 12th, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Finished the coding of the credit card checkout from #DailyUI 002. Started reading about serverless.com to upload a bot on a private slack channel. I tried to code a simple function but I didn't succeed on it. I was able to create a service with `serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path nameOftheProject` and desploy it. 

**Thoughts:**: I'm struggling with the time again. I have some work so I'm thinking on droping the #DailyUI challenge || not being so tryhard about the design challenge.
