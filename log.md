# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 10th, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Working on the code of my #DailyUI design. I got some of it done, about 30% I think. I have to finish it tomorrow morning so I can do tomorrows coding too.

**Thoughts:**: Struggled with time managment. I wasted time thinking what was going to be today's task. Tomorrow I have to be more efficient in my thought process.

### Day 2: April 11th, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I worked on the code of a design I did for the Daily UI (day 2). It was about a credit card checkout. I need to solidify my knowledge about CSS, so I'm trying write as much css as I can. Nothing fancy, but it has to be functional. I went deep into pseudoelements, background, positioning with z-index, some event listeners on javascript, for the button & input effects.

**Thoughts:**: It's not easy to find time to do everything, I'm struggling with it, but I think it going to be worth. Besides I'm practicing my english, which is nice.

### Day 3: April 12th, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Finished the coding of the credit card checkout from #DailyUI 002. Started reading about serverless.com to upload a bot on a private slack channel. I tried to code a simple function but I didn't succeed on it. I was able to create a service with `serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path nameOftheProject` and desploy it. 

**Thoughts:**: I'm struggling with the time again. I have some work so I'm thinking on droping the #DailyUI challenge || not being so tryhard about the design challenge.

### Day 4: April 13, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I continued a Vuejs course (Max Schwarzmueller) and thought about doing something I've done on Angular - Dynamic forms. I't was actually pretty simple. I don't know how to make validation like the one you can do in Angular, tho. I did a patients form where you can add as many patients as you want, in the same form (without submitting), and inside that form there is another array - the first being the patients array-, the patologies array that lives within
each patient. So it's a nested array. Having it done in angular, again, it was much easier in Vue and I understood the core conceptos of it before hand.

**Thoughts:**: I keep spending a lot a time in the #DailyUI challenge. I'm also with a freelance client that I need to keep progressing. I'll push myself on not leaving the design challenge, I need those design skills.

### Day 5: April 14, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I had little time and tried to work on a grid to show projects on my protfolio site. I've been using grid quite a lot and I feel more confident with it. I still need to practice more tho.

**Thoughts:**: I'm feeling kinda stressed about spending so much time designing on XD and less time coding. I spend time also reading documentation and watching tutorials, so the time I have to actually code is very little.

### Day 6: April 15, 2019
**Today's Progress**: More work on grid and flexbox. Just doodled on codepen

**Thoughts:**: 

### Day 7: April 16, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Started reading documentation on @gridsome. I want to use it on a freelance project that came out. I'm trying to understand the difference between static/dynamic/SPA websites, I stil can't understand completely. I hope tomorrow every doubt about it is cleared.

**Thoughts:**:

### Day 24: May 3, 2019
**Today's Progress and thoughts**: I stopped posting since D.003, I’ll make a quick summary from what has been this 20 days and try to never miss a day again updating this repo.

I was doing Max Schwarzmuller’s VueJS course cause the idea was to hustle a bit with contracting/freelancing some websites for local customers in my city. I started reading about server side rendering and static site generators, so I stumbled on @gridsome. Meanwhile I practiced VueJS syntax and CSS on projects that I was doing in the same course. After this, there was a christian holiday on the third weekend of April I think and I’ve always had this thing for React, even though my first framework was Angular and now I was learning Vue, so I thought “why not”. On top of it when I bought the Vue course, they offer me the React course too, and bought both, more reasons to try React for the weekend. The rest is history. I’ve been doing React’s course the last 10 days and I’m loving it. It’s so simple, no keywords, no special syntax (or almost none), just javascript. Beside the course coding exercises I did a project where you enter your location and it returns you the 24h drugstore in your city. It works only if you are from my country cause it uses a government API. I also went through @GatsbyJS documentation and the beginners exercises and started working on a client project using React Gatsby. 

Today I realized that I was trying go deep on using just functional components on my Gatsby project but I’m lacking some fundamentals about them. The first parts of the React course I did where focused primarily in Class components. So I’m thinking in going back to the course or finishing it with class comps. Finally, I’m trying to set up GCloud to make one http requests a day to get the 24h drugstore because right now I have to manually set the .json file with the drugstores -I first make the http request from the browser, copy the response, paste in my local .json, then commit/push and netlify  builds again. The day ended trying to set up functions on firebase of GCP but I wasn't successful about it. It was very frustrating.
