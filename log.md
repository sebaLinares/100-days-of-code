# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 10th, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Working on the code of my #DailyUI design. I got some of it done, about 30% I think. I have to finish it tomorrow morning so I can do tomorrows coding too.

**Thoughts:**: Struggled with time managment. I wasted time thinking what was going to be today's task. Tomorrow I have to be more efficient in my thought process.
