# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 10th, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Working on the code of my #DailyUI design. I got some of it done, about 30% I think. I have to finish it tomorrow morning so I can do tomorrows coding too.

**Thoughts:**: Struggled with time managment. I wasted time thinking what was going to be today's task. Tomorrow I have to be more efficient in my thought process.

### Day 2: April 11th, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I worked on the code of a design I did for the Daily UI (day 2). It was about a credit card checkout. I need to solidify my knowledge about CSS, so I'm trying write as much css as I can. Nothing fancy, but it has to be functional. I went deep into pseudoelements, background, positioning with z-index, some event listeners on javascript, for the button & input effects.

**Thoughts:**: It's not easy to find time to do everything, I'm struggling with it, but I think it going to be worth. Besides I'm practicing my english, which is nice.

### Day 3: April 12th, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Finished the coding of the credit card checkout from #DailyUI 002. Started reading about serverless.com to upload a bot on a private slack channel. I tried to code a simple function but I didn't succeed on it. I was able to create a service with `serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path nameOftheProject` and desploy it. 

**Thoughts:**: I'm struggling with the time again. I have some work so I'm thinking on droping the #DailyUI challenge || not being so tryhard about the design challenge.

### Day 4: April 13, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I continued a Vuejs course (Max Schwarzmueller) and thought about doing something I've done on Angular - Dynamic forms. I't was actually pretty simple. I don't know how to make validation like the one you can do in Angular, tho. I did a patients form where you can add as many patients as you want, in the same form (without submitting), and inside that form there is another array - the first being the patients array-, the patologies array that lives within
each patient. So it's a nested array. Having it done in angular, again, it was much easier in Vue and I understood the core conceptos of it before hand.

**Thoughts:**: I keep spending a lot a time in the #DailyUI challenge. I'm also with a freelance client that I need to keep progressing. I'll push myself on not leaving the design challenge, I need those design skills.

### Day 5: April 14, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I had little time and tried to work on a grid to show projects on my protfolio site. I've been using grid quite a lot and I feel more confident with it. I still need to practice more tho.

**Thoughts:**: I'm feeling kinda stressed about spending so much time designing on XD and less time coding. I spend time also reading documentation and watching tutorials, so the time I have to actually code is very little.

**Today's Progress**: More work on grid and flexbox. Just doodled on codepen

**Thoughts:**: 

### Day 7: April 16, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Started reading documentation on @gridsome. I want to use it on a freelance project that came out. I'm trying to understand the difference between static/dynamic/SPA websites, I stil can't understand completely. I hope tomorrow every doubt about it is cleared.

**Thoughts:**:
